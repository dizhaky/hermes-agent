        carrier.
      * Credential / secret stores under HERMES_HOME and the global Hermes
        root: ``auth.json``, ``auth.lock``, ``.anthropic_oauth.json``,
        ``.env``, ``webhook_subscriptions.json``, ``auth/google_oauth.json``,
        and anything under ``mcp-tokens/``. These hold plaintext provider keys,
        OAuth tokens, and HMAC secrets that the agent never needs to read
        directly — provider tools / gateway adapters consume them through
        internal channels.
      * Project-local environment files anywhere on disk: ``.env``,
        ``.env.local``, ``.env.development``, ``.env.production``,
        ``.env.test``, ``.env.staging``, ``.envrc``. These routinely hold

        need to read these — ``.env.example`` is the documented-shape
        substitute.

    **This is NOT a security boundary.** The terminal tool runs as the
    same OS user with shell access; the agent can still ``cat auth.json``
    or ``cat ~/.hermes/.env`` and exfiltrate the file. The read-deny exists
    as defense-in-depth that:

      * Returns a clear error to models that respect tool denials, which
        empirically prompts most modern models to stop rather than reach
        for the shell.
      * Surfaces a visible audit trail when something tries to read
        credentials — easier to spot in logs than a generic ``cat``.

    Treat any user-visible framing around this as "may help" rather than
    "stops attackers." A determined model or malicious instruction can
    always shell out.

    Callers that resolve relative paths against a non-process cwd
    (e.g. ``TERMINAL_CWD`` in ``tools/file_tools.py``) MUST pre-resolve
    and pass the absolute path string.  This function's own ``resolve()``
    is anchored at the Python process cwd, so a relative input like
    ``"auth.json"`` would otherwise miss the denylist when the task's
    terminal cwd differs from the process cwd.

    """Extract ``tar`` into ``dest`` with ``data``-filter semantics everywhere.

    ``tarfile``'s ``filter="data"`` landed in 3.11.4 while this project supports
    ``>=3.11``, so 3.11.0–3.11.3 have no filter. The obvious stopgap — validate
    the members yourself, then call an unfiltered ``extractall`` — is what this
    replaces, because **a lexical pre-flight check cannot be equivalent to the
    filter.** Three rounds of review found three separate bypasses of exactly
    such a check:

    1. a clean *name* on a symlink whose *target* escapes, with a later member
       written through it;
    2. hardlink targets, which ``tarfile`` resolves against the extraction root
       rather than the link's parent, so symlink math under-resolves them;
    3. and the one that settles it — an earlier symlink member changing what a
       later member's path *means*. Given ``a -> .``, a directory ``a/b``, and
       ``a/b/link -> ../../outside``, the link's lexical depth is 2 but its real
       depth is 1, so the target normalizes as contained while landing outside.
       Reproduced: the check accepted the archive and ``a/b/link/pwned`` was
       written beside the destination.

    Containment depends on what earlier members created, which a check over
    member metadata cannot know. So on interpreters without the filter this
    does not call ``extractall`` at all: it writes each member itself, creating
    only directories and regular files. Nothing that can redirect a later path
    is ever created, which makes the traversal question moot instead of
    answering it correctly. This mirrors ``hermes_cli.psutil_android``, which
    ``main`` reached independently for the psutil sdist.

    Paths are still validated, under both POSIX and Windows rules — ``os.path``
    on Windows also splits on ``\\`` and honours drive letters, so
    ``..\\outside`` and ``C:\\outside`` are escapes there while looking like
    one opaque component to ``PurePosixPath``.

    **How link members are handled, and why the two kinds differ.** Symlinks
    are refused outright: honouring one safely means resolving through links
    already created, which is the complexity that produced the bypasses above.
    Hardlinks are *materialized as copies* instead — ``tarfile.add()`` stores
    the second occurrence of an inode as a ``LNKTYPE`` member, so an ordinary
    snapshot of a skills tree containing hardlinks has them, and refusing those
    would make a backup unrestorable on exactly the interpreters this serves.
    A copy carries the same content and, unlike a link, cannot be used to reach
    anything else.

    So this is stricter than ``data`` for symlinks (``data`` allows a contained
    one) and equivalent for everything else. The divergence applies to
    3.11.0–3.11.3 only; on 3.11.4+ the real filter runs and a contained symlink
    is restored as a symlink.

    Refuses outright where the platform cannot enforce that. An earlier version
    fell back to plain path operations here and documented the hole, on the
    grounds that it merely preserved pre-existing behaviour — but a fallback
    that silently performs no enforcement, inside the function whose whole
    purpose is to guarantee it, is not a gap worth documenting. It is one worth
    closing.

    The combination this refuses is narrow: an interpreter old enough to lack
    ``filter="data"`` (3.11.0–3.11.3) *and* a platform without ``dir_fd``
    support (Windows). On 3.11.4+ the real filter runs and this is never
    reached.

    Stated more sharply than the first version of this comment managed: on
    that combination **every** curator rollback fails before restoring its
    first entry, and ``requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.14"`` still advertises it
    as supported. That is a real gap, not a rounding error, and the honest fix
    is to floor ``requires-python`` at ``3.11.4`` so the package stops claiming
    a configuration it cannot serve. Left undone here only because this
    environment's ``uv`` cannot parse the repo's ``uv.lock`` schema, so the
    lockfile cannot be regenerated and ``uv lock --check`` would fail CI —
    tracked as a follow-up rather than shipped broken.

    The alternative — hand-rolling reparse-point checks for Windows — is
    deliberately not taken. It would be security-critical code for a platform
    this sandbox cannot execute, and every hand-rolled containment scheme in
    this module's history has been bypassed. Refusing is verifiable; a second
    unverified guard is not.

# exists, and explicit user direction is required to cross it.
