"""Regression tests for ``agent.file_safety.safe_extract_tar``.

``tarfile``'s ``filter="data"`` landed in 3.11.4 while ``requires-python`` is
``>=3.11``, so 3.11.0–3.11.3 have no filter. This module's contract is that
extraction is safe on those interpreters *too* — not by validating members and
then calling an unfiltered ``extractall``, but by never calling it.

The tests therefore assert the property that matters — **nothing lands outside
the destination** — by extracting for real and looking at the filesystem,
rather than asserting that a particular check fires. Three separate bypasses of
the previous lexical check are pinned here as escape scenarios; each one passed
that check while writing outside.

Its live consumer is ``agent.curator_backup``, which extracts into the
**skills** directory — executable content, not a throwaway temp dir.
